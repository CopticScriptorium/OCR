# OCR
Repository for development files and documentation for Coptic OCR in development by Coptic Scriptorium. 

Much of this work is based on prior work from other researchers that was shared publicly. Please credit the prior researchers along with Coptic Scriptorium.

## OCR4All files
Models and training files for [OCR4All](https://www.ocr4all.org/) were developed from [original work by Eliese-Sophia Lincke, et al.](https://vcs.etrap.eu/Coptic-OCR/datasets). The OCR4All team converted the training files and produced a model for the newer version of OCR4All and provided them to Coptic Scriptorium.
